## $\LaTeX$ Support

Thanks to [Haixing Hu's tutorial](https://haixing-hu.github.io/programming/2013/09/20/how-to-use-mathjax-in-jekyll-generated-github-pages/) and [Gianluca Casati's tutorial](https://g14n.info/2014/09/math-on-github-pages/), I use Kramdown and MathJax to support $$\LaTeX$$ in my posts.
